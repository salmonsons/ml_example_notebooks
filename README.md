# ml_example_notebooks

This repository is for notebooks demonstrating various machine learning techniques; their purpose is to be simple rather than extensive and attempting to build the best possible model.

### Regression

There are four regression notebooks, each predicting Yacht Residual Resistance. They use the following techniques:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees & Random Forests
- Neural Networks (MLP)
- K Nearest Neighbors

### Classification

There are five classification notebooks, each predicting a type of wine. They use the following techniques:
- Logistic Regression
- SVM
- Decision Trees & Random Forests
- Naive Bayes
- Neural Networks
